africa accounts for only 5 % of china ' s overall foreign trade and investment .
this is dwarfed by china ' s investment in the us , for example , where it has accumulated $ 1.3 trillion in us government debt alone .
chinese premier li keqiang has been explicit about his country ' s desire to form a progressive relationship with the continent , based on mutual respect , with a commitment to develop african communities .
it is instructive that , although africa accounts for only a small fraction of china ' s foreign investment , it has received nearly half of china ' s total foreign aid .
for africa , the focus must be on building the right environment for investment .
in building ties with asia , african governments have an opportunity to learn from the region ' s economic success stories , while boosting their own countries ' industrial development .
much of asia ' s investment in africa has focused on infrastructure that directly supports african priorities : telecoms , power plants and transmission lines , water and sanitation , roads and railways , ports , aviation , and airports .
these investments represent a long-term commitment , and africa benefits in many ways , gaining not only jobs today , but also a more advanced industrial base that will underpin employment and drive economic growth long into the future .
these investments also support africa ' s drive toward greater mobility , higher productivity , and a more prominent role in world trade .
and , by fostering competition for projects and mobilizing a more diverse pool of investors , they have enhanced africa ' s economic security .
of course , short-term investment and economic growth cannot come at the expense of medium-term social development and job creation or long-term sustainability and stability .
we understand this , and so do our partners .
it is the responsibility of all african governments to ensure that investments and partnerships - whether with emerging-market investors such as china , brazil , india , and the gulf states , or with europe and the us - are built on fair terms .
to see the ties between africa and asia as part of a battle between east and west is simplistic , outdated , and , above all , wrong-headed .
greater interest in the continent is the result of reforms that have emboldened foreign investors - from both east and west - and of africa ' s growing ability to get the best deal for its economy and people .
three humanitarian challenges for africa in 2018
nairobi - in mid-2017 , when a cholera outbreak in somalia threatened to overwhelm local hospitals , health experts feared the worst .
with crippling drought , malnutrition , and poverty already endemic , an outbreak of deadly diarrhea seemed destined to paralyze the fragile state .
but , despite the dire predictions , institutional paralysis was avoided .
although hundreds died and many more became sick , the collective response managed by governments , ngos , and local communities , including the national red crescent societies supported by the red cross movement , contained the disease .
somalia ' s experience gives me great hope for africa ' s future .
but it also serves as a reminder that local capacity is easily inundated during times of crisis .
while some parts of africa have become self-sufficient in terms of public health , others continue to lean heavily on global aid .
for these areas , partnership is the best means of minimizing risks .
in particular , three key challenges this year are likely to pose the severest tests of africa ' s ability to manage humanitarian crises .
the first challenge is violence in the democratic republic of the congo .
last year , conflict in the drc ' s central kasai region displaced some 1.4 million people , bringing the total displaced population to 4.1 million - the largest concentration of internal refugees anywhere in africa .
the violence has exacerbated food insecurity , with more than three million people severely undernourished .
unfortunately , the kasai crisis is expected to worsen in 2018 .
a recent assessment by the red cross society of the drc warns that the number of people displaced will continue to rise , and with a fast-spreading cholera outbreak threatening the region , a coordinated plan of action is urgently needed .
the second challenge this year is somalia ' s food insecurity , which , according to the famine early warning systems network , is expected to intensify this year .
below-average rainfall in 2017 stunted harvests , and most regions have not fully recovered .
as humanitarian aid is channeled to the country , efforts must be made to target long-term solutions , such as improving agricultural output , educational access , and economic opportunity .
historically , most aid to the country has been earmarked for emergency relief even the collective cholera response was narrowly focused on short-term health .
but somalia desperately needs a more holistic , long-term development strategy .
finally , the very scourge that somalia contained last year will continue to rear its head elsewhere in the region .
yemen ' s cholera outbreak is now the largest in history , having already surpassed one million confirmed cases , and , despite years of international assistance , the threat continues to stalk africa .
in the last four decades , african countries reported over three million suspected cholera cases to the world health organization and new cases are cropping up this year in africa ' s east-central and southern regions .
fortunately , there is hope that somalia ' s containment success in 2017 can be replicated , provided that communities and individuals are well aware of the disease and related risks , and that local actors receive the needed resources .
the global task force on cholera control , which seeks to build local and international support for improved health care and sanitation , has published a global roadmap for ending cholera by 2030 .
although that is an ambitious target , it is achievable if international organizations and local governments work together .
natural and manmade crises will continue to plague africa , but organizations like mine are working hard to bring about a brighter future through improved capacity building .
to succeed , however , local and international development partners must reorient their thinking humanitarian aid alone will not solve africa ' s myriad challenges .
while money is clearly needed , it must be spent more strategically to improve structural weaknesses that perpetuate instability .
for example , if more funding were devoted to community-level health care projects , local organizations would be better positioned to lead when outbreaks threaten .
put simply , the international development community must do more to invest in grassroots solutions , empowering africans rather than treating them as subcontractors to their own suffering .
not only are local organizations better positioned to navigate complex cultural and linguistic landscapes they also have more to lose if they fail .
last year was devastating for many africans , as millions suffered from drought , hunger , and violence .
but in somalia , a coordinated response to a serious health threat offered new hope for a more secure future .
when local ingenuity and international support align , the cycle of suffering can be broken .
for many african countries , the ability to look confidently beyond the next crisis is the first step on the long road to self-reliance .
africa , climate change , and the g-8 summit
british prime minister tony blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the g-8 summit this july will be african poverty and global climate change .
these may seem to be distinct issues .
in fact , they are linked .
a trip i took to a village in the tigre region in northern ethiopia shows why .
one morning , i was taken to a dry riverbed at the village ' s edge .
farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed , down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level .
they explained that until recently this was a perennial river - one that flows throughout the year - but now the river stops flowing during the dry season .
only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed .
until then , water-starved communities dig for water , if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out .
in northern ethiopia , as in much of africa , the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years .
ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops , one during a short rain in march and april , and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months .
in recent years , the short rains have failed entirely , and long rains have been erratic .
hunger is omnipresent .
perhaps half of the children are severely underweight .
much of arid sub-saharan africa , notably in the sahel ( the region just south of the sahara desert ) , has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century .
this decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring indian ocean , a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming .
failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger , but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water .
when violence erupts in water-starved regions such as darfur , sudan , political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms .
if they act at all , they mobilize peacekeepers , international sanctions , and humanitarian aid .
but darfur , like tigre , needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers .
soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people .
one course of action must be to help impoverished african regions to ' adapt ' to climate change and to escape the poverty trap .
water-stressed regions like ethiopia and sudan can adapt , at least in part , through improved technologies such as ' drip irrigation , ' rainwater harvesting , improved water storage facilities , deep wells , and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall .
better land-management practices ( the re-planting of degraded forests , for example ) can recharge underground water aquifers .
poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own .
nor should they have to .
help for poor countries in africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid , but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet .
greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered .
in addition to adapting to climate change , the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases , which are the source of man-made climate change .
while adaptation to climate change is necessary - because it is already occurring - this is not enough .
if the world fails to mitigate future climate change , the effects of rising temperatures , increasing droughts , more numerous and severe tropical storms , rising sea levels , and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet .
the famines in ethiopia and the violence in darfur suggest what can lie ahead .
the best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions .
there are at least three options : shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants economize on energy use , for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks .
most likely , all three of these methods will have to play a role .
the effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action , but , given the long lead times in overhauling the world ' s energy systems , we must start now .
rich countries need to lead the way .
it is ironic that the united states , which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries , gives the smallest share of its gnp in aid among the rich countries , and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
this is especially ironic because african countries like ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the us in the fight for freedom and against terrorism , even as they struggle with hunger , disease , and famine .
moreover , countries like ethiopia are making valiant , indeed remarkable , efforts to overcome their problems , despite the lack of adequate , and long-promised , help from the world ' s richest countries .
africans suffering from hunger and drought , and indeed poor people everywhere , have a right to ask much more of the us and other rich countries .
tony blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises .
capitalizing on africa ' s demographic dividend
lomÉ - africa is home to the world ' s youngest and fastest-growing population .
with as many as 20 million young people poised to join the workforce every year for the next three decades , the continent has an opportunity to shift the balance of local and global growth with a purpose : jobs .
but it is far from inevitable that it will do so .
for african countries to capitalize on this demographic dividend , the future workforce must be educated , trained , and have adequate employment opportunities .
putting all the pieces in place will not be easy .
these are uncertain times for the global economy .
trade tensions between the united states and china are threatening the integrity of global value chains , and britain ' s looming exit from the european union has the potential to cause even more disruption .
the international monetary fund ' s october forecast warns that as historic economic drivers stall , global growth this year and next could fall to 3.7 % , a decline of 0.2 percentage points from previous estimates .
but as this slowdown gets priced in by stock markets around the world , new drivers of growth will emerge .
africa is well positioned to become one of them .
according to the world bank , six of the world ' s ten fastest-growing economies are in africa .
intra-african trade might be the gateway to future local and global growth , with the continent ' s burgeoning population forging new opportunities across borders .
most significantly , africa ' s labor force is on the verge of a dramatic expansion .
today , 60 % of africans are younger than 25 , and 41 % are under the age of 15 .
by 2050 , africa ' s youth population is expected to reach 840 million .
but this massive pool of potential talent is a double-edged sword .
despite strong gdp growth over the last ten years , the majority of young people in africa could not capture economic opportunities .
furthermore , the african union oecd report africa ' s development dynamics 2018 highlights that if the underemployment trend continues , africa ' s young people will suffer the most .
failing to employ africa ' s young people fully could marginalize an entire generation and lead them down a path of disruption for which we may not be prepared .
for countries to experience job-led long-term growth , the provision of quality opportunities in agriculture is vital .
if that does not happen , and quality jobs remain scarce , the economic expansion of which africa is capable will not happen .
in other words , african governments are facing a deadline to match job growth with skills training .
unfortunately , at the moment , few countries are addressing this challenge effectively .
according to the african development bank , the unemployment rate for young people in africa is already double the rate for adults .
in fact , young people are being let down even before they start looking for work .
too many primary schools suffer from crippling teacher shortages , for example , and gender discrimination prevents millions of girls from even attending high school .
to overcome these shortcomings will require significant investments of political and financial capital .
some leaders are moving in this direction .
at the paris peace forum ( ppf ) , held earlier this month , african and global leaders gathered to discuss the powerful idea that international cooperation is the key to tackling global challenges and ensuring durable peace .
on the sidelines of the ppf , the focus fell on african youth .
the au-eu youth cooperation hub , one of 119 projects selected to participate in the forum , attended the meeting to discuss the au-eu youth agenda .
striving to involve young people across africa and europe in decisions that impact them , now and in the future , this initiative aims to showcase strategies for bringing africa and europe together to address challenges such as the demographic dividend .
one approach to capitalizing on africa ' s demographic boom is to expand the availability of training initiatives that pair employers ' needs with african talent .
as a former fellow with the ibrahim leadership program , i can attest to the transformative power of top-tier educational schemes and their value as incubators for job-related skills .
africa ' s success relies on its ability to harness its demographic dividend by equipping its youth with technological and innovative skills , which will be a catalyst for economic growth .
this includes training and agriculture-focused programs to absorb skills along the value chains that connect raw materials to industries and markets across africa .
by 2030 , one in every five people on the planet will be african .
because of its size alone , africa ' s labor force will have the potential to drive global growth for decades .
but to do so , africans must implement the necessary reforms today .
as our demographic dividend matures , governments , institutions , and organizations must help position young people for success .
if african countries can meet this challenge , prolonged economic growth - at home and abroad - will be the reward .
africa ' s middle passage to development
yaoundÉ - when it comes to relations with china - and development strategies more generally - there are two opposing camps in africa .
but the approach that will bring the most progress is a ' middle passage ' that smooths contradictions and offers a balanced , accommodative , and pragmatic vision behind which africans can unite .
on one side of the issue are china optimists .
cooperation with china , they argue , could enable africa to chart its own development course , independent of western policy prescriptions .
this group is sympathetic to the ' beijing model ' of governance , which focuses on national sovereignty and state control .
on the other side are china pessimists .
they worry that the dynamic in sino-african relations would always favor china .
they prefer the west ' s democracy-oriented approach , which emphasizes individual rights , underpinned by the free market agenda embodied in the so-called washington consensus .
the third group comprises the ' china accommodators , ' who combine the optimists ' goals with the pessimists ' wariness .
they emphasize the need for a common african strategy toward china that minimizes the relationship ' s asymmetries .
represented by the new partnership for africa ' s development ( nepad ) , the accommodators champion democracy , the rule of law , and human rights but , like china , they oppose western interference .
one reason that the principle of non-interference is so critical is that african countries , like china , have long suspected a distinct western bias in the conception of ' fundamental human rights . '
for example , as western countries increasingly move to protect gay rights , the expectation has arisen that aid recipients follow suit , placing such rights above the ' national rights ' of the government .
in 2014 , the united states and europe cut aid to uganda , owing to a bill imposing penalties on homosexual activities .
a similar bias is evident in criticism by the west - and by africa ' s pro-western china pessimists - of china ' s so-called resource diplomacy in africa .
after all , china ' s approach is no different from america ' s long-standing oil-based relationships with countries like saudi arabia .
and it is not as if the historical involvement in africa of revered democracies like france was shaped by the values of ' liberty , equality , and fraternity . '
in this context , while it is obviously critical that african countries protect their citizens ' individual rights , external views of what constitutes such a right should not trump legitimate sovereign authority .
similarly , international law should not create space for some countries to criticize and punish other countries regarding issues that are settled in accordance with domestic democracy and law .
this includes the selective application of law by the international criminal court .
another clash that nepad aims to resolve is that between economic rights , or ' the right to bread , ' which the beijing model supporters put first , and political rights , or ' the right to vote , ' emphasized by the pro-western camp .
here , the key is sequencing .
given that a starving person would most likely give up their vote in exchange for some bread , one can surmise that a certain level of prosperity must be achieved before political rights become the top priority .
and , however committed the china pessimists are to free markets , there is no denying that china ' s state-controlled economy has lifted millions of people out of poverty and created a rapidly burgeoning middle class .
this suggests that african countries , too , would benefit from a similar focus on economic growth , which will demand engagement with dynamic economies like china ' s .
in fact , while the pessimists may not like the idea of closer ties with china , the reason it is necessary - economic globalization - actually derives from the washington consensus principles that they so cherish .
in any case , once a strong middle class has been established , the focus can shift toward building a credible and sustainable liberal democracy .
the need for a two-pronged approach to development , incorporating elements of the beijing model and the washington consensus , has been underscored by the outcome of the arab spring revolts of 2011 .
a lack of economic opportunities was a major driver of the pro-democracy demonstrations in tunisia , egypt , and others .
but the belief that the right to vote would support the right to bread did not quite work out .
in fact , despite the overthrow of authoritarian regimes , egypt has so far proved unable to build credible democratic governments or enforce the rule of law effectively , change in tunisia remains tenuous , and libya is substantially worse off - economically and politically - than it was before 2011 .
perhaps if sovereign rights had been better respected , with outside powers supporting consensus-building processes instead of coups d ' état , political breakthroughs could have been achieved , opening the way for economy-boosting initiatives against relatively stable backgrounds .
yet the west seems not to have learned its lesson .
indeed , it has long demanded that syrian president bashar al-assad cede power before a credible peace process can begin .
though western leaders have softened their position in recent months , the damage has been done : uncertain of his physical survival , assad unleashed a horrific civil war , from which the islamic state has benefited considerably .
and he remains in power .
none of this is to condone the repressive policies of the authoritarian leaders - from egypt ' s hosni mubarak to libya ' s muammar el-qaddafi - whose regimes were overthrown .
the point is rather to emphasize the potential benefits of a more stability-oriented approach , in which the drive to secure political rights is reconciled with the principles of respect for national and sovereign rights reflected in the beijing model .
china ' s growing involvement in africa is important not just for the direct economic benefits it can provide , but also for the impact it can have on development strategies .
with an approach that merges chinese and western models - balancing human rights with national interests , individual rights with sovereign authority , and political rights with economic goals - african countries could enhance their development prospects considerably .
africa ' s opportunity in addis
dakar - this week , addis ababa , ethiopia ' s capital and a city full of symbolic importance for all of africa , will host the third international conference on financing for development .
most developing countries hold high expectations for the conference .
they hope it will offer new means to improve social welfare at a time when financing their development needs has become increasingly difficult .
for most african countries , the key challenge nowadays is structural economic transformation .
simply put , our economies must be able to create enough good jobs to employ growing populations .
africa is home to one billion people , 74 % of whom are younger than 24 , and 61.3 % of whom are women .
the united nations predicts that by 2040 , just one generation from now , africa ' s total population will exceed two billion - 70.1 % under the age of 25 , with women accounting for 57.7 % .
these young men and women need - and are increasingly demanding - high-quality education and jobs .
thus , african governments must seize this opportunity to advocate for increased financing for sustainable development , building on the mobilization of more significant domestic revenue .
the good news is that there has been real progress on this front .
at both the national and regional levels , policymakers are paying greater attention to domestic resource mobilization as a means of leveraging the effectiveness of external assistance .
in this context , strengthening our countries ' administrative capacity is critical , for it will enable us to make the best possible use of the financial and technical assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral institutions .
nonetheless , the fact remains that , in addition to domestic financial resources , mobilization of external resources will be needed to meet additional financing needs and achieve the sustainable development goals , the 15-year global framework that the un will adopt in september .
indeed , given the constraints on the capacity of most african countries to attract private financing , it is critical that the international community increase official development assistance ( oda ) if the sdgs are to be achieved .
that is why we must encourage multilateral institutions such as the african development bank ( afdb ) , the international monetary fund , and the world bank to continue to improve african countries ' access to their concessional and non-concessional resources .
they should also support our efforts to realign the existing frameworks for mobilizing oda and ensure more timely and predictable access to external financing , along the lines established by the paris declaration on aid effectiveness , which specifies guidelines for monitoring and measuring how donor financial assistance is used .
in this sense , the conference in addis is being held at an opportune moment , because it coincides with efforts to revise the rules of the international tax system .
some 14 countries , including senegal , are involved in the implementation of the base erosion and profit shifting ( beps ) project , which seeks to create greater transparency in taxation regimes .
but we recognize that we must go beyond beps and address broader issues related to the fiscally costly tax incentives found in investment , mining , and petroleum codes .
these incentives often deprive our governments of resources that could be used to fund essential development projects .
the addis meeting also provides a unique opportunity for a deeper analysis of issues related to illicit financial activities - another big drain on african treasuries .
indeed , the revenue shortfalls induced by such activities are estimated to cost african countries between $ 30-60 billion a year , a sum that falls within the neighborhood of total oda received by africa ( $ 46.1 billion in 2012 ) .
sadly , the problem has been getting worse in recent years .
that is why i welcome the us-africa partnership to combat illicit finance , which aims to promote transparency in public financial management , combat corruption , strengthen judiciaries and the rule of law , and ensure greater accountability to civil-society and private-sector actors .
the partnership ' s first meeting was held in dakar on june 25 , with a view to establishing a working group comprising several african countries and observers from organizations such as the afdb , the imf , the world bank , and the oecd .
achieving greater transparency in public administration will require sustained implementation of projects - such as the extractive industries transparency initiative ( eiti ) , the construction sector transparency initiative , and others - that shine a spotlight on the behavior of governments and investors .
similarly , revising mining and petroleum codes , as appropriate , could help improve transparency and ensure more equitable revenue-sharing arrangements between investors and the countries in which they operate .
this week ' s conference in addis ababa should lay the foundation for more effective external financing of sustainable development over the course of the sdgs .
but the quality of what is built on that foundation will depend on the commitment and mobilization of all actors , particularly those from africa .
africa ' s path from poverty
beijing - all low-income countries have the potential for dynamic economic growth .
we know this because we have seen it happen repeatedly : a poor , agrarian economy transforms itself into a middle- or even high-income urban economy in one or two generations .
the key is to capture the window of opportunity for industrialization arising from the relocation of light manufacturing from higher-income countries .
that was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , and it remains true today .
japan seized its opportunity in the years following world war ii , using labor-intensive industries , such as textiles and simple electronics , to drive its economy until rising labor costs eroded its comparative advantage in those sectors .
and now that china , too , is beginning to lose its comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries , other developing countries - especially in africa - are set to take its place .
indeed , ever since the industrial revolution , the rise of light manufacturing has driven a dramatic rise in national income .
in belgium , france , sweden , denmark , italy , and switzerland , light manufacturing led the way .
similarly , in the united states , cities like boston , baltimore , and philadelphia became centers for producing textiles , garments , and shoes .
until recently , few believed that africa , too , could become a center for modern manufacturing .
but , with the right policies , there is no reason why african countries could not follow a similar trajectory .
consider land-locked ethiopia , which only ten years ago seemed to be an especially bad bet .
but then the country built an industrial park near addis ababa and invited the chinese shoemaker huajian to open a factory there .
huajian opened its doors in january 2012 with two production lines and some 600 workers .
today , the company has 3,500 workers in ethiopia producing more than two million shoes a year .
within three months , all of them had been leased by export-oriented companies from turkey , korea , taiwan , china , and elsewhere .
the world bank has provided $ 250 million to support the continued construction of these industrial parks .
the ethiopian success story is just the start .
as investors learn more about africa , they will increasingly see what it has to offer .
indeed , the cost of labor in africa is competitive enough that ethiopia could attract companies from countries as poor as bangladesh .
africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs .
as foreign firms launch operations in the labor-intensive sectors in which africa has a comparative advantage , they will train the local workforce .
some workers will become managers .
they will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line .
they will establish contacts with international buyers and investors .
and , eventually , some of them will be able to raise capital and start firms of their own - export companies owned and operated by africans .
mauritius shows the path ahead .
in the 1970s , the government set up industrial parks to process textiles and garments for export .
a carefully focused export strategy is crucial .
the international development community and many african governments want to work toward regional integration , linking the markets of 55 african countries .
this might have its advantages , but it should not be a priority .
africa today accounts for just 1.9 % of global gdp , compared to 21 % for the united states and 23 % for europe .
developing countries must use their limited resources in the most effective way , and there is no question where the most attractive opportunities in africa are to be found .
for example , instead of investing heavily in the infrastructure needed for regional integration , a country like ethiopia would be better off building industrial parks and linking them by road to ports in djibouti .
my native taiwan is now a high-income economy .
but when i was born there , in 1952 , the island was poorer than almost every country in africa .
then it happened to me again .
today , china has become an upper-middle-income country , and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020 .
my hope is that i can witness a third economic transformation in my lifetime , this time in ethiopia and other countries in africa .
if they stay on the tried and tested path of those who have gone before , there is every chance that i will .
the promise of digital health
basel - africa has changed remarkably , and for the better , since i first worked as a young doctor in angola some 20 years ago .
but no change has been more obvious than the way the continent has adopted mobile technology .
people in africa - and , indeed , throughout low- and middle-income countries - are seizing the opportunities that technology provides , using mobile phones for everything from making payments to issuing birth certificates , to gaining access to health care .
the benefit of mobile technologies lies in access .
barriers like geographical distance and low resources , which have long prevented billions of people from getting the care they need , are much easier to overcome in the digital age .
and , indeed , there are countless ways in which technology can be deployed to improve health-care access and delivery .
of course , this is not new information , and a growing number of technology-based health initiatives have taken shape in recent years .
but only a few have reached scale , and achieved long-term sustainability the majority of projects have not made it past the pilot phase .
the result is a highly fragmented landscape of digital solutions - one that , in some cases , can add extra strain to existing health systems .
the first step to addressing this problem is to identify which factors breed success - and which impede it .
here , perhaps the most important observation relates to how the solution is linked to the reality on the ground .
after all , technology is an enabler for the innovation of health-care delivery , not an end in itself .
solutions that focus on end-users , whether health practitioners or patients , have the best chance of succeeding .
fundamental to this approach is the recognition that what users need are not necessarily the most advanced technologies , but rather solutions that are easy to use and implement .
in fact , seemingly outdated technologies like voice and text messages can be far more useful tools for the intended users than the latest apps or cutting-edge innovations in , say , nanotechnology .
consider the community-based hypertension improvement project in ghana , run by the novartis foundation , which i lead , and fhi 360 .
the project supports patients in self-managing their condition through regular mobile medication reminders , as well as advice on necessary lifestyle changes .
this approach is successful because it is patient-centered and leverages information and communication technology ( ict ) tools that are readily available and commonly used .
in a country where mobile penetration exceeds 80 % but only a few people have smartphones , such simple solutions can have the greatest impact .
for health practitioners , digital solutions must be perceived as boosting efficiency , rather than adding to their already-heavy workload .
co-creating solutions with people experienced in delivering health care in low-resource settings can help to ensure that the solutions are adopted at scale .
for example , the telemedicine network that the novartis foundation and its partners rolled out with the ghana health service was a direct response to the need , expressed by health-care practitioners on the ground , to expand the reach of medical expertise .
the network connects frontline health workers with a simple phone call to consultation centers in referral hospitals several hours away , where doctors and specialists are available around-the-clock .
from the outset , the project was a response to an expressed need to expand the reach of medical expertise , and was fully operated on the ground by ghana health service staff , which made this model sustainable at scale .
to realize the full potential of digital health , solutions need to be integrated into national health systems .
only then can digital technology accelerate progress toward universal health coverage and address countries ' priority health needs .
collaboration across the health and ict sectors , both public and private , is essential .
multidisciplinary partnerships driven by the sustained leadership of senior government officials must guide progress , beginning at the planning stage .
intra-governmental collaboration , dedicated financing for digital health solutions , and effective governance mechanisms will also be vital to successful strategies .
digital technologies offer huge opportunities to improve the way health care is delivered .
if we are to seize them , we must learn from past experience .
by remaining focused on the reality of end-users and on priority health needs , rather than being dazzled by the latest technology , we can fulfil the promise of digital health .
confronting africa ' s water challenge
abidjan - water is essential for life , and yet it is scarce in many parts of the world .
owing to the effects of climate change , africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945 , especially in southern sudan , somalia , ethiopia , and northern nigeria .
these fragile areas now need the global community ' s support .
we need to build resilient systems to ensure access to potable water for all people , and to improve water-delivery and sanitation provisions in africa ' s rapidly growing urban areas .
we should begin by expanding africans ' capacity to harness wastewater .
with investment and proper management , wastewater can become a sustainable source of wealth for many africans , with added benefits for human health , agricultural productivity , and environmental sustainability .
over the past six years , the african development bank has invested $ 3.3 billion in projects to expand access to water and improve sanitation , with around $ 2.2 billion of that going to urban services that reach at least 17 million people .
the afdb supports an integrated urban water-management model ( iuwm ) that , in keeping with united nations sustainable development goal 6 , enables communities to derive a sustainable income from management of urban liquid and solid waste .
iuwm efforts require a significant initial investment , and come with steep capital and operational costs .
only a few african cities collect and treat any more than 20 % of the wastewater generated through centralized wastewater-management systems .
the remaining 80 % constitutes a huge untapped source of potentially valuable liquid and solid waste .
with the right investment , foresight , and commitment , this underappreciated resource can create jobs and deliver sustainable growth .
wastewater management is thus a central feature of the afdb ' s strategic priorities , known as the high 5s , which aim to improve africans ' quality of life , boost public health , achieve gender equality , create jobs , and increase communities ' resilience to the effects of climate change .
water will also play a key role in reaching the high 5s ' industrialization and sustainable-farming objectives .
in yaoundé , cameroon , the afdb helped to protect some 300,000 people and their property by reducing the frequency of floods from 15 incidents per year to just three .
and with a $ 40 million sanitation project , the afdb helped to lower the proportion of the city ' s malaria-afflicted population from 16 % to 12 % .
in abidjan , cte d ' ivoire , the $ 23 million afdb-funded gourou basin integrated watershed management project significantly reduced flooding throughout the gourou basin , and improved 2.8 million inhabitants ' livelihoods .
in zimbabwe , after 4,300 people died in the 2008-2009 cholera pandemic , the afdb and other donors supported the $ 43.6 million urgent water supply and sanitation rehabilitation project , which made emergency repairs to wastewater systems in urban areas , helping 2.5 million people .
all afdb-supported wastewater-management systems follow sustainability strategies to ensure that they enhance economic gains , benefit local communities , and remain affordable .
these projects also help countries to harness and use waste flows , by converting sewage to biogas and fertilizer .
meanwhile , the afdb ' s african water facility ( awf ) complements its project-finance work by attracting downstream investments in water infrastructure .
in february , flooding and strong winds from tropical storm dineo devastated the coast of mozambique and had a severe impact on the local population .
but just a few weeks later , the awf launched a feasibility study to improve livelihoods and climate-change resilience throughout mozambique ' s inhambane province , where the storm struck .
in collaboration with the global water partnership , the awf is implementing iuwm systems in five african cities , including kinshasa in the democratic republic of congo and marondera in zimbabwe .
in the drc alone , iuwm systems can be expected to improve water delivery and sanitation for 17 million people by 2030 .
this effort will help to develop business innovations for affordable and sustainable sanitation services in africa , which could reach two million urban dwellers directly and another six million people through subsidiary projects .
africa ' s wastewater-management challenges are substantial and complex .
but the afdb is determined to provide opportunities that pay dividends for african communities - in public health , improved sanitation , economic development , and environmental protection .
improving the quality of life for all africans will require political commitment , public-private partnerships , and robust public involvement .
with the high 5s framework , the afdb is working to bring these three ingredients together .
all stakeholders - in africa and internationally - must redouble our efforts to ensure clean , affordable water for all , and to support african countries suffering through a historic drought .
we have a moral obligation to do so .
after all , water means life .
is africa still rising washington , dc - between 2000 and 2014 , africa grew at a strong clip , fueling belief in the narrative of an ' africa rising . '
but , since 2015 , growth across sub-saharan africa has weakened , and the poor outlook for commodity prices has cast doubt on africa ' s economic promise , leading many to question the ' africa rising ' narrative - and some to pronounce it dead .
such skepticism is , to some extent , understandable .
the 2014 oil-price shock hit several african economies especially hard , and played a role in pushing aggregate growth down from 5-6 % in 2004-2014 to just 2.5 % in 2015-2017 - a rate that barely keeps up with population growth .
last year , angola and south africa ' s economies stagnated , while the nigerian economy actually contracted for the first time since 1991 .
the latest projections suggest that these economies will experience tepid recoveries in the coming years .
but africa ' s skeptics have overlooked a number of important factors .
for starters , when one sets the three largest economies aside , sub-saharan africa ' s aggregate-growth rate for this year rises from 2.5 % to almost 4 % .
that is faster than the 3.5 % rate at which the global economy is currently growing .
in fact , five of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in africa .
and over the next five years , around half of all sub-saharan economies will expand at an average rate similar to or higher than that which prevailed during the ' africa rising ' heyday .
furthermore , high commodity prices were just one factor in the region ' s strong economic performance between 2000 and 2014 .
many african countries have made vast improvements to macroeconomic management , governance , and the business environment , and entrepreneurship is on the rise .
even with lower commodity prices , these developments will continue to bolster many african economies .
today ' s skepticism may reflect lasting memories from a darker period , and fears that africa ' s progress has not been sufficiently consolidated .
from the 1970s to the mid-1990s , dictators ruled in many african countries , and the institutions necessary for sustaining strong economic growth were fragile at best .
with civil wars constantly shredding the social fabric in many countries , the continent experienced decades of tepid economic growth .
by 2000 , it had been reduced to what the economist called ' hopeless africa . '
but those days are gone .
policymakers across the continent have sustained the 1990s-era reforms that set the stage for the subsequent period of high growth .
although there is still much work to be done , the economic and business environment in many african countries has continued to improve , and institutions and governance have grown stronger .
owing to new information and communication technologies , africans , particularly young africans , are better informed , more engaged in civil and political discourse , and increasingly capable of holding their leaders accountable .
icts have also unleashed a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship across the continent .
these positive trends are not likely to be reversed , and will continue to improve the economic conditions in africa , even if commodity prices do not rebound .
after all , the region ' s economic growth averaged 5.6 % between 2000 and 2004 , before commodity prices had begun their rapid ascent .
but that is not to say africa will be spared from daunting challenges in the years ahead .
globally , the economic environment will become less favorable for african economies .
in the major advanced economies , interest rates will soon rise , and the political backlash against globalization may force governments to abandon their past commitments to development assistance .
in light of all this uncertainty , african policymakers should look inward , by focusing on policies to mobilize national resources and finance their economic agendas .
those agendas should include a number of key priorities .
african countries need to diversify their economies to withstand future shocks better , while also accelerating the pace of industrialization across the continent .
governments will have to find a way to create decent jobs for the 11 million people now entering the region ' s labor force every year .
and they will need to enact policies to reduce poverty , and ensure that prosperity is shared across all cohorts of society .
these are particularly important goals for angola , nigeria , and south africa .
angola and nigeria need to become far less reliant on oil and south africa still needs to implement far-reaching reforms to address structural problems that have plagued it since the apartheid era .
seeing these projects through will require competent political leaders who are committed to the principles of good governance .
failure could result in an extended period of low growth .
but even if africa ' s three largest economies do end up in the doldrums , it will not necessarily seal the fate of the ' africa rising ' story .
after all , ' africa rising ' need not mean ' all ' of africa .
from the 1960s to the 1990s , the ' asian tigers ' narrative referred only to hong kong , singapore , south korea , and taiwan , excluding other developing countries in asia , such as china .
similarly , african economies are increasingly differentiating themselves , and should thus be evaluated individually , on the merits of their respective economic policies .
africa still rising
johannesburg - is the honeymoon over for african economies less than a decade ago , it seemed that the continent ' s economic dreams were beginning to come true , with many countries experiencing impressive gdp growth and development .
now , as the harsh reality of the continent ' s vulnerability to challenging external conditions has set in , sustaining that growth has proved difficult .
encumbered by slowing growth in china , a collapse in commodity prices , and adverse spillover from numerous security crises , africa ' s overall annual gdp growth averaged just 3.3 % in 2010-2015 , barely keeping up with population growth - and down sharply from the 4.9 % recorded from 2000 to 2008 .
but a deeper look suggests that things may not be as bad as they seem , for two key reasons .
first , though average growth has declined , some african economies have thrived in recent years .
indeed , aggregate gdp has been dragged down since 2010 by faltering growth among oil exporters and security-related crises in the sahel and north africa but in the rest of africa , gdp growth has accelerated , from 4.1 % in 2000-2010 to 4.4 % in 2010-2015 .
second , africa is undergoing a profound long-term transformation , characterized by rapid digitization , urbanization , and growth in the working-age population , which will outnumber the labor force of china and india by 2034 .
that demographic trend could unlock future growth by advancing economic diversification , spurring domestic consumption , and supporting industrialization .
in fact , today ' s high-growth countries - including cte d ' ivoire , ethiopia , kenya , and tanzania - have made substantial progress in reducing their dependence on commodity exports , in favor of trade , investment , and domestic consumption .
and many lower-growth countries could head down a similar path .
new research by the mckinsey global institute ( mgi ) shows that spending by africa ' s consumers and businesses already totals $ 4 trillion .
by 2025 , private spending could reach $ 5.6 trillion - $ 2.1 trillion by households , and $ 3.5 trillion by businesses .
this represents a huge opportunity for africa  s manufacturers .
we believe that africa can almost double its manufacturing output , to nearly $ 1 trillion , by 2025 , with about 75 % of that growth tied to production for local markets .
the question is whether manufacturers will manage to exploit the growth potential that lies in front of them .
african firms have not yet proved capable of meeting existing domestic demand .
africa still imports about one-third of the food , beverages , and similar processed goods it consumes , whereas the association of southeast asian nations imports about 20 % , and south america ' s mercosur trade bloc imports just 10 % .
africa even imports 15 % of the cement it uses , despite having abundant raw materials to make it at home .
to be sure , african business has made great strides in recent years .
today , 400 african companies have annual revenue of more than $ 1 billion , and 700 have annual revenue of more than $ 500 million .
on the whole , these large companies are growing faster - and generating higher profits - than their global peers .
but there is still a long way to go .
large african ( excluding south african ) firms ' average annual revenue of $ 2 billion is half that of large firms in brazil , india , mexico , and russia .
and africa only has about 60 % of the large firms it needs to put it at the same level as the emerging economies .
one key factor limiting firms ' growth is the fragmented nature of the african market , which currently comprises mostly small economies with only limited economic and political linkages .
there are eight partly overlapping regional trade zones , none of which includes more than half of africa ' s countries .
only egypt , morocco , nigeria , and south africa rank in the top 100 of mgi ' s global connectedness index .
beyond excessive trade barriers , africa suffers from inadequate transport links and limits on the free movement of people .
africans need visas to travel to more than half the countries on their own continent .
the recent launch of the african union passport is a step in the right direction - but it is only one step .
a more integrated market would not only enable african companies to create the economies of scale they need to compete it would also be far more appealing to institutional investors .
building such a market must therefore be a top priority for african leaders , as they seek to unleash the continent ' s economic potential .
equally important , africa ' s leaders must work to improve the business environment .
though some progress has been made on this front in the last two decades , non-tariff barriers remain high .
indeed , regulatory issues are still cited as a serious deterrent to investment .
many african businesses - nearly half of companies in nigeria , and more than one-third in angola and egypt - highlight unreliable electricity supplies as a major challenge .
and almost 40 % of firms surveyed by the world bank lament the constraints imposed by competition from informal firms .
some of these issues could be addressed relatively quickly .
consider the strides rwanda has made since 2007 , when it established a development board to improve its business environment .
in less than a decade , that board has led the creation of a ' one-stop center ' to facilitate investment , has overseen streamlined issuance of construction permits , and has pressed successfully for a fixed fee for property registration , the extension of customs hours , and risk-based customs inspections .
as a result , rwanda ' s global ranking for the ease of doing business jumped from 143 in 2008 to 32 in 2014 .
this success can surely be replicated elsewhere in africa .
despite the challenges some african countries face , the continent ' s economic potential remains massive , thanks to favorable demographic dynamics , fast-growing cities , burgeoning domestic markets , and a digital revolution .
with the right policies , a relentless focus on execution , and a great deal of determination , africa can still rise .
africa ' s arrival
new york - the african development bank ( afdb ) has just published its african economic outlook for 2018 .
this year ' s revamped publication - shorter than usual , analytically well-structured , and written in lucid prose , without hyperbole - in some ways mirrors africa ' s own transformation , as it raises hopes that we may at last be witnessing the continent ' s long-promised economic arrival .
africa ' s rise has been a long time coming .
in the 1960s , hopes were high .
the remarkable leaders of the independence generation - such as ghana ' s kwame nkrumah and kenya ' s jomo kenyatta - received advice from the world ' s top economists .
the caribbean-born nobel laureate arthur lewis became nkrumah ' s chief economic adviser .
in india , we read about these leaders ' friendship with our own post-independence prime minister , jawaharlal nehru , and the hope for a new dawn for all emerging economies .
and many emerging economies did indeed take off .
in the late 1960s , some east asian economies surged ahead .
beginning in the early 1980s , china began its decades-long rise .
and , from the early 1990s , india ' s economy also began to grow robustly , with annual rates reaching the 9 % range by 2005 .
but africa remained stagnant , mired in poverty .
ironically , it was the continent ' s resource wealth that hampered economic progress , as it fueled conflicts among governments and insurgents eager to control it .
the resulting political instability attracted outsiders keen to exploit governments ' weakness .
as the indian poet and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore put it in his 1936 poem ' ode to africa , ' which played on perceptions about who is ' civilized , ' the continent fell prey to ' civilization ' s barbaric greed , ' as the colonists ' arrived , manacles in hand claws sharper by far than any of your wolves . '
finally , at the turn of the twenty-first century , things began to change for africa .
a few dynamic leaders , democratic stirrings , and emerging regional cooperation led to a decline in poverty and a pickup in growth .
commodity exporters faced a setback around 2014 , when prices plummeted .
but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise , because it forced countries to diversify their economies and increase production - factors that supported renewed growth .
according to the afdb report , africa ' s 54 economies grew by 2.2 % in 2016 , on average , and 3.6 % in 2017 .
in 2018 , the afdb predicts , average growth will accelerate to 4.1 % , while the world bank expects ghana to grow by 8.3 % , ethiopia by 8.2 % , and senegal by 6.9 % , placing these countries among the world ' s fastest-growing economies .
and these figures are not wishful thinking : in 2016 , ethiopia ' s gdp grew by 7.6 % .
of course , serious challenges remain .
south africa , the continent ' s strongest economy , is now facing the difficult task of tackling its deep-rooted corruption .
yet , with the african national congress now apparently determined to replace president jacob zuma ' s scandal-ridden administration with one led by the party ' s new leader , cyril ramaphosa , there is reason for hope .
more broadly , many african countries need to find ways to create more employment - and fast .
the share of the working-age population is rising faster in africa than in any other region .
this ' demographic dividend ' has immense potential .
but if job creation stalls , the unemployed or under-employed are likely to become frustrated - a recipe for conflict .
consider the case of tanzania .
thanks to president john magufuli ' s effort to mobilize more domestic revenue to support increased development spending , the economy is doing well .
but , with roughly 800,000 individuals entering the labor force each year , tanzania needs much more working capital , better infrastructure , and educational reform aimed at ensuring that workers have the skills , resources , and opportunities to secure decent jobs .
the same is true of ethiopia .
in the last couple of decades , the country has made great strides in export-led growth , supported by a growing industrial sector and large investments from china .
now , it is poised to take over as the economic powerhouse of east africa .
yet the urban youth unemployment rate stands at 23.3 % .
left unchecked , this situation could easily end up fueling ethnic conflict and political turmoil .
another , related challenge concerns resource mobilization : countries need funds to invest in infrastructure , human capital , and the creation of trade and digital links within and beyond africa .
the afdb report estimates that , for infrastructure investment alone , the continent needs some $ 170 billion per year , which is $ 100 billion more than is currently available .
as it stands , africa receives a total of about $ 60 billion in foreign direct investment each year .
to close the gap , african governments must attract more money .
that will require establishing effective regulatory structures that facilitate long-term borrowing and repayment , while ensuring that lenders do not exploit borrowers , as has occurred everywhere from rural india to the united states mortgage market .
the challenges are daunting , to say the least .
but there are lessons that african countries can learn from one another .
for example , ghana ' s smooth transfer of power after the december 2016 election set a positive democratic example .
nigeria ' s lagos state and tanzania have done a good job of mobilizing internal resources for development .
add to that the emergence of an indigenous intelligentsia in the region , exemplified by organizations like the afdb , and it seems that africa ' s moment may have arrived at last .
uniting against malaria
lomÉ gaborone - as african women leading influential and impact-driven organizations - the ecobank foundation and the african leaders malaria alliance ( alma ) - we are passionate about building a prosperous , inclusive , and sustainable african economy .
but achieving that goal requires accelerating progress toward eradicating the diseases that continue to deplete our communities of their most valuable resource : healthy people .
one such disease is malaria .
to be sure , africa has lately made significant progress in combating malaria .
from 2010 to 2015 , as part of the global millennium development goals , the continent reduced the malaria incidence rate ( the number of new infections ) by 21 % and malaria deaths by 31 % .
but malaria remains a serious threat to the wellbeing of millions of africans .
in 2015 , an estimated 212 million people contracted malaria worldwide , with 47 % of cases concentrated in just six african countries .
an estimated 429,000 people - mostly children under five years of age - died from malaria that year , with 92 % of those deaths occurring in africa and 40 % occurring in just two countries , nigeria and the democratic republic of congo .
there is , therefore , an urgent need to accelerate progress - and end malaria for good .
this is both a moral and economic imperative .
preventable illnesses and deaths limit the ability of communities to contribute to africa ' s much-needed economic transformation .
in many african countries , malaria reduces gdp growth by one percentage point per year .
the effort to end malaria can therefore not be separated from the effort to ensure prosperity across africa .
the copenhagen consensus think tank estimates that every dollar invested in ending malaria yields $ 36 in economic returns .
to reap these benefits , african countries must increase domestic-resource mobilization substantially .
africa ' s private sector , in particular , has a crucial role to play in developing innovative solutions that address malaria ' s growing resistance to existing drugs , as well as mosquitoes ' growing resistance to insecticides .
moreover , the private sector can help to address inefficiencies in supply-chain management and logistics , thereby facilitating distribution of insecticides and long-lasting insecticidal nets .
of course , even with private-sector investment , progress toward eradicating malaria in africa will be uneven , not least because different countries are at different points on the path .
senegal - where the share of malaria-related outpatient visits fell from 36 % in 2001 to just 3.3 % last year - is now on track to achieve so-called pre-elimination by 2020 .
meanwhile , other african countries - such as angola and somalia - are struggling to make any progress at all , as indicated in the alma scorecard for accountability and action .
no single african country can reliably eliminate malaria so long as the disease remains rampant among its neighbors .
malaria does not , after all , respect borders .
that is why it is vital for african governments to work together , using every tool at their disposal , to achieve comprehensive malaria control , pre-elimination , and , ultimately , elimination .
alma - a coalition of 49 african heads of state and government working to eliminate malaria by 2030 - aims to advance precisely such cooperation , by focusing on accountability and action at the national , regional , and global levels .
alma provides management tools , such as the scorecard for accountability and action , that help to track progress , identify obstacles and bottlenecks , and advance solutions .
these tools are versatile and adaptable throughout the continent .
where needed , alma has provided support to address challenges directly with countries , in cooperation with partners , or through results-based management structures .
the ecobank foundation is also doing its part : its investment of both cash and in-kind services and training have enhanced the impact of the global fund partnership in africa .
by helping to strengthen the financial-management capabilities of grant recipients in nigeria , senegal , and south sudan , the foundation is unlocking funding for health programs in those countries - and is now expanding its support to chad and zambia .
and there is more .
through its digital financial platform , the ecobank foundation is leveraging its presence to bring in new funding for the fight against malaria .
and it is raising awareness as well , among its own staff and other stakeholders , of how to support malaria prevention , including through mosquito nets and a clean environment .
the goal of eradicating malaria in our lifetime may sound ambitious , but it is achievable .
together , africa ' s governments and private sector can produce the investment and action needed to stop the disease for good - and ensure greater prosperity across the continent .

africa ' s schooling without learning
accra - as the school year began this september , there was welcome news for ghana ' s nearly half-million students entering high school : president nana akufo-addo had fulfilled his campaign promise of free secondary education for children nationwide .
