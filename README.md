# subword-to-word

This repository is the main hub of work my MSc Dissertation "Word Embedding Reconstruction Methods for Language Modelling".

## Repository Contents
This repository is a mix of my own work and forks from other repositories.  

`beginnerLM` is a fork of [PyTorch Tutorials: Language Models](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/02-intermediate/language_model/main.py)  

`charCNN` is a reimplementation of [Learning to Generate Word Representations using Subword Information](https://github.com/kamigaito/rnnlm-pytorch), which I use as a reconstruction method.

`compact_reconstruciton` is a fork of [Compact Reconstruction](https://github.com/losyer/compact_reconstruction), which I use as a reconstruction method.
  
`distance_measuring` has inital tests of the quality of the reconstructed embeddings compared to reference embeddings

`results` is where I put my results!

`rnnlm-pytorch-master` is a fork of [RNN-based language models in pytorch](https://github.com/kamigaito/rnnlm-pytorch),
which I use to build a language model and evaluate perplexity of various embeddings

Todo :)
